You should then see a similar page with a confirm password text box. You can use Google or Github to instantly signup for an account.

Using the traditional username/password method will send a confirmation email to you to verify. You will not be able to sign into your account without verifying through that email.

After that, you should be able to sign in to your new account. You should see the following page while your account is being created. This is a 1-2 minute process while netmaker provisions a free tier server for you to start.
