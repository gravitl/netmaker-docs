Once you have your license key and account ID, you can get the nm-quick installer and run it. 

.. code-block::
    
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/scripts/nm-quick.sh
    chmod +x nm-quick.sh
    bash nm-quick.sh

You can upgrade from an existing community server to a pro server with this script. Follow the prompts to setup a pro server and the script will make the necessary changes to your netmaker.env file and grab the pro docker-compose.override.yml file.

If you prefer to upgrade manually, go to your netmaker server and add the following to your netmaker.env file.


.. code-block:: yaml

    LICENSE_KEY: “<license key>”
    NETMAKER_TENANT_ID: "<tenant id>"

Also change ``SERVER_IMAGE_TAG`` in netmaker.env to ``<version>-ee``. For example: ``SERVER_IMAGE_TAG=v0.20.3-ee`` 

Also change the ``INSTALL_TYPE`` from ce to pro.

Then you will need to get the docker-compose pro file from here

.. code-block::

    wget -O docker-compose.override.yml https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/blob/master/compose/docker-compose.pro.yml

No changes will need to be made to that file. It will use the configs listed in your netmaker.env file.

After that ``docker kill netmaker netmaker-ui && docker-compose up -d`` and you should see the professional UI on dashboard.<YOUR_BASE_DOMAIN>

You should see a new Dashboard. The top menu bar will have relays and metrics added.

(Optional) Setup your server for Prometheus and Grafana
==========================================================

If you would like to use Netmaker's custom Prometheus exporter and Grafana dashboard, your docker-compose.override.yml file will already have those section.

In Netmaker.env, change the following:

.. code-block::

    METRICS_EXPORTER=on
    PROMETHEUS=on
