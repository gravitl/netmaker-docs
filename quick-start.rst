Quick Install

Important Notes
============================

1. **WE RECOMMEND USING THE NM-QUICK SCRIPT INSTEAD OF THIS GUIDE. Our docker-compose files have changed sizeably and the install script now uses a different process to obtain certificates. The script can be found** `on GitHub <https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker#get-started-in-5-minutes>`_ **(raw script** `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/scripts/nm-quick.sh>`_ **). If you would like to install netmaker manually, You can use the instructions below.**

2. Due to the high volume of installations, the auto-generated domain has been rate-limited by the certificate provider. For this reason, we **strongly recommend** using your own domain. Using the auto-generated domain may lead to a failed installation due to rate limiting.

3. This guide is just a manual version of the steps performed by that script, and is therefore more prone to error.

4. You must decide if you are installing the Pro version of Netmaker or the Community version. We recommend Pro because of its substantial free limits, but it does require `an account <https://app.netmaker.io>`_.

5. If deploying to DigitalOcean, you should use the `DigitalOcean 1-Click <https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/netmaker>`_, which uses the interactive script.

6. This instance will not be HA. However, it should comfortably handle 100+ concurrent clients and support the most common use cases.

7. For information about deploying more advanced configurations, see the :doc:`Advanced Installation <./server-installation>` docs. 

0. Prerequisites
==================
-  **Virtual Machine**
   
   - Preferably from a cloud provider (e.x: DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, GCP, etc.)
   
   - We **highly recommend** that Netmaker be deployed in a dedicated networking environment. It should not share a local network with the clients which it will be managing. This can cause routing issues.

   - We do not recommend Oracle Cloud, as VM's here have been known to cause network interference.

   - The machine should have a public, static IP address 
   
   - The machine should have at least 1GB RAM and 1 CPU (2GB RAM preferred for production installs)
   
   - 2GB+ of storage 
   
   - Ubuntu 21.04 Installed

- **Domain**

  - A publicly owned domain (e.x. example.com, mysite.biz) 
  - Permission and access to modify DNS records via DNS service (e.x: Route53)
  - **Note on Cloudflare:** Many of our users use Cloudflare for DNS. Cloudflare has limitations on subdomains you must be aware of, which can cause issues once Netmaker is deployed. Cloudflare will also proxy connections, which MQ does not like. This can be disabled in the Cloudflare dashboard. If setting up your Netmaker server using Cloudflare for DNS, be aware that the configuration of Cloudflare may cause problems with Netmaker which must be resolved, and at this point, Netmaker is not providing guidance on this setup.

1. Prepare DNS
================

Create a wildcard A record pointing to the public IP of your VM. As an example, \*.netmaker.example.com. Alternatively, create records for these specific subdomains:

- dashboard.domain

- api.domain

- broker.domain

- turn.domain

- turnapi.domain

If deploying Pro, you will also need records for the following:IsStatic

- grafana.domain

- prometheus.domain

- netmaker-exporter.domain


2. Install Dependencies
========================

.. code-block::

  ssh root@your-host
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose 

At this point you should have all the system dependencies you need.
 
3. Open Firewall
===============================

Make sure firewall settings are set for Netmaker both on the VM and with your cloud security groups (AWS, GCP, etc). 

Make sure the following ports are open both on the VM and in the cloud security groups:

- **443, 80 (tcp):** for Caddy, which proxies the Dashboard (UI), REST API (Netmaker Server), and Broker (MQTT)  
- **3479, 8089 (TURN, TURN api):** Port 3479 is commonly used for UDP traffic related to TURN. Similar to STUN, TURN servers need to work effectively with firewalls and NAT devices. By using the reserved port 3479, TURN servers can better handle communication across various network configurations. Port 8089 is not reserved specifically for TURN but is commonly associated with TURN server deployments.
- **51821-518XX (udp):** for WireGuard - Netmaker needs one port per network, starting with 51821, so open up a range depending on the number of networks you plan on having. For instance, 51821-51830.  
- **8085 (exporter Pro):** If you are building a Pro server, you need this port open.
- **1883, 8883 8083, 18083 (if using EMQX):** We use two different types of brokers. There is Mosquitto or EMQX. if you are setting up EMQX, these four need to be open for MQTT, SSL MQTT, web sockets, and the EMQX dashbaord/REST api.


.. code-block::

  sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 443 
  sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80 
  sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 3479
  sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 8089 
  sudo ufw allow 51821:51830/udp
  

It is also important to make sure the server does not block forwarding traffic (it will do this by default on some providers). To ensure traffic will be forwarded:

.. code-block::

  iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT


**Again, based on your cloud provider, you may additionally need to set inbound security rules for your server (for instance, on AWS). This will be dependent on your cloud provider. Be sure to check before moving on:**
  - allow 443/tcp from all
  - allow 80/tcp from all
  - allow 3479/tcp from all
  - allow 8089/tcp from all
  - allow 51821-51830/udp from all
  
4. Prepare MQ
========================


You must retrieve the MQ configuration file for Mosquitto and the wait script.

.. code-block::

  wget -O /root/mosquitto.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/docker/mosquitto.conf
  wget -q -O /root/wait.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/docker/wait.sh
  chmod +x wait.sh

5. Install Netmaker
========================

Prepare Docker Compose 
------------------------

As of 0.20.0, our docker-compose and Caddyfile now contains references to a netmaker.env file. This will cut down on repetitive entries like inserting your base domain multiple times. You only insert it once in your netmaker.env file and the backend handles placing it in the right places. The EMQX and Pro docker-composes are now extensions of the regular docker-compose file, so switching to Pro or EMQX doesn't involve recreating an entire docker-compose file.

Get the base docker-compose and Caddyfile.

.. code-block::

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/compose/docker-compose.yml
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/docker/Caddyfile

If you plan on using a Professional server (Pro), then you will need to grab the Caddyfile-pro file instead. There will be more Pro related instructions below in "Extra Steps for Pro".

.. code-block::

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/docker/Caddyfile-pro

You can grab the netmaker.env file here.

.. code-block::

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/scripts/netmaker.default.env
  cp netmaker.default.env netmaker.env

You can then use a text editor like vim or nano to go in there and fill out the fields. There is an example below to reference. You can get your ip with the command ``ip route get 1 | sed -n 's/^.*src \([0-9.]*\) .*$/\1/p'``. You can also generate random strings for the master key and TURN and MQ passwords with the command ``tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 30 ; echo ''`` or you can enter them manually if desired. For the base domain again, we advise you use your own domain, because nip.io can hit rate limiting easily from the high volume when obtaining certificates. If you do want to use nip.io, just enter ``nm.<YOUR_IP_WITH_DASHES_INSTEAD_OF_DOTS>.nip.io``.

Extra Steps for Pro
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Visit `<https://app.netmaker.io>`_ to create your account on the Netmaker SaaS platform.
2. Create a tenant of type ``self-hosted`` to obtain a license key. more details in :doc:`Netmaker Professional setup <./pro/pro-setup>`
3. Retrieve Tenant ID and license key from the tenant's settings tab.
4. Place the licence key and tenant ID in the netmaker.env file.
5. In the netmaker.env file, change the METRICS_EXPORTER and PROMETHEUS from off to on.
6. Grab the docker-compose.pro extension file from the repo and change its name to docker-compose.override.yml.

.. code-block::

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/compose/docker-compose.pro.yml


You will not need to make any changes to this file. It will reference the current netmaker.env file.

6. Get Certificates
===================

Start by grabbing our nm-certs shell script, make it executable, and run it.

.. code-block::

  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitl/netmaker/master/scripts/nm-certs.sh
  chmod +x nm-certs.sh
  bash nm-certs.sh 

If the script runs successfully, you should see a message like ``SSL certificates ready``.

Then run 

.. code-block::

  ln -fs /root/netmaker.env /root/.env

7. Start Netmaker
==================

``sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --force-recreate``

navigate to dashboard.<your base domain> to begin using Netmaker.

To troubleshoot issues, start with:

``docker logs netmaker``

Or check out the :doc:`troubleshoooting docs <./troubleshoot>`.
