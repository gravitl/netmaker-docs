IMPORTANT: Notes on Installation

- Due to the high volume of installations, the auto-generated domain has been rate-limited by the certificate provider. For this reason, we **strongly recommend** using your own domain. Using the auto-generated domain may lead to a failed installation due to rate limiting.


Choose the install method that makes sense for you.

**For most users, we recommend the** :doc:`Quick Install<./quick-start>` **guide.**
