Netclient Setup
================================

As of v0.18.0 Netclient is now in its own standalone repo seperate from netmaker.

The UI has been updated for Mac and Windows,

And the CLI has been updated.

The Netclient manages WireGuard on client devices (nodes). This document walks through setting up the netclient on machines, including install, management, and uninstall.


The Netclient is supported on the following operating systems:

* Linux (most distributions)
* Windows
* macOS
* FreeBSD

For unsupported devices, please use the external client, which is just a static, vanilla, WireGuard configuration file, which can be added to any device that supports WireGuard.

******************
Installation
******************


Before adding the machine to a network, the netclient must be installed. A successful installation sets up the netclient executable on the machine and adds it as a system daemon. The daemon will listen for changes for any network it joins.

The client install **does not** add the client as a member of any network. Once the client is installed, you must run:

.. code-block::

  netclient join -t <token>

The following are install instructions for most operating systems.

Linux
=============

Debian Distros (debian/ubuntu/mint/pop-os)
------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block::

  curl -sL 'https://apt.netmaker.org/gpg.key' | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/netclient.asc
  curl -sL 'https://apt.netmaker.org/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/netclient.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install netclient


Red Hat Distros (fedora/redhat/centos/rocky)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block::

  curl -sL 'https://rpm.netmaker.org/gpg.key' | sudo tee /tmp/gpg.key
  curl -sL 'https://rpm.netmaker.org/netclient-repo' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/netclient.repo
  sudo rpm --import /tmp/gpg.key
  sudo dnf check-update
  sudo dnf install netclient

Arch Distros (arch/manjaro/endeavouros)
------------------------------------------------

  brew install netclient

GUI Installer

Download Link for Apple Intel: https://fileserver.netmaker.org/latest/Netclient-Intel.pkg

FreeBSD
=============

A FreeBSD package is planned. In the meantime, please use one of the following commands (select the correct one for your version of FreeBSD) to install the netclient on FreeBSD. 
To install on pfSense or OPNsense, ensure that wireguard package is installed and enabled. Use the FreeBSD version corresponding to your installation (use uname -r to check your version).
.. code-block::

  fetch -o /tmp/netclient https://fileserver.netmaker.io/releases/download/v0.20.4/netclient-freebsd13-amd64 && chmod +x /tmp/netclient && sudo /tmp/netclient install
  fetch -o /tmp/netclient https://fileserver.netmaker.io/releases/download/v0.20.4/netclient-freebsd14-amd64 && chmod +x /tmp/netclient && sudo /tmp/netclient install


Docker
=============

You can run Netclient using Docker instead of installing it on your local machine.  To ensure that the correct commands are present in order to use Docker use these steps:

.. code-block::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose 

After that you can proceed to join the network using the docker command from the access key for the network you wish to join.  The docker command is available from the access key view in the Netmaker UI.  To have the netclient docker container restart (eg after the system reboots) you'll want to use the following option when running docker run:

.. code-block::

  --restart=always


If you prefer (e.g., when specifying a lot of environment variables), you can use a docker-compose.yml file such as the following instead of the docker run command:

.. code-block::

  version: "3.4"

  services:
      netclient:
          network_mode: host
          privileged: true
          restart: always
          environment:
              - TOKEN=<networktoken>
          volumes:
              - '/etc/netclient:/etc/netclient'
          container_name: netclient
          image: 'gravitl/netclient:v0.18.0'

where <networktoken> is the Access Token available from the "Viewing your Access Key Details" window in the Netmaker UI.

If you are making a docker container on a server that already has a baremetal version of netclient on there, this will create a conflict. Netmaker will only make one host for that machine and not see the container as another node. Meanwhile on the client, both daemons will be running (bare metal and container), causing conflicts (both receive the peer updates) and the node becomes unreachable.

You can work around this by running the docker netclient using a seperate netclient folder and having host networking NOT enabled. Host networking must be turned off when running with multiple netclients. This means that the host will not have the private address of the container and it will be segmented.

Your compose would look more like this:

.. code-block::

  version: "3.4"

  services:
      netclient:
          privileged: true
          restart: always
          environment:
              - TOKEN=<networktoken>
          volumes:
              - '/etc/netclient2:/etc/netclient'
          container_name: netclient2
          image: 'gravitl/new-netclient:v0.18.0'

By using this method, you can run many netclients on the same host and just incrementing up (netclient3, netclient4 ..... netclientN).


**IMPORTANT:**
 For docker netclient to function correctly as either ingress/egress gateway, you need to additionally run the following commands on the host machine:

  1. `iptables -I DOCKER-USER -i netmaker  -j ACCEPT`
  2. `iptables -I DOCKER-USER -o netmaker  -j ACCEPT`

******************
Joining a Network
******************

The join command provides the following flags with short descriptions on what each one does.

.. image:: images/netclientjoincli.png
  :width: 80%
  :alt: netclient CLI
  :align: center

With a token:

.. code-block::

  netclient join -t <token>

With username/password:

.. code-block::

  netclient join -n <net name> -u <username> -s api.<netmaker domain>
  (example: netclient join -n mynet -u admin -s api.nm.example-domain.io)

With SSO (oauth must be configured):

.. code-block::

  netclient join -n <net name> -s api.<netmaker domain>

With docker:

.. code-block::

  docker run -d --network host  --privileged -e TOKEN=<TOKEN> -v /etc/netclient:/etc/netclient --name netclient gravitl/netclient:<CURRENT_VERSION>

Again, if you are making a docker container on an already existing baremetal netclient, you will have to modify the join command like this for example:

.. code-block::

  docker run -d --privileged -e TOKEN=<TOKEN> -v /etc/netclient2:/etc/netclient --name netclient2 gravitl/new-netclient:<CURRENT_VERSION>

And again host networking will be turned off in this case and will not have the private address of the contianer and it will be segmented.

These commands will be available to copy and paste in the access keys section of your netmaker UI. You can set the verbosity to a level 0-4 with the flag ``-v <number 0-4>`` in the join command if you need more info about the join.

To join on the GUI with Windows or Mac, just click the ADD NEW button and you will be given a choice of token or Username/Password.
